# Exploratory Data Analysis and Time Series Modeling for Rossmann Store Sales

## Project Description
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis and time series modeling of sales data from 1,115 Rossmann stores. The data used in the project is sourced from Kaggle. The goal of the project is to understand sales dynamics, detect trends and seasonality, and build effective models for predicting sales in individual stores.

## Data
The data used in the project was provided by Kaggle as part of the "Rossmann Store Sales" competition. The dataset contains information about sales in 1,115 Rossmann stores, along with data regarding promotions, competition, and store information.

## Required Libraries
The project utilizes several popular Python libraries, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing input data.
- `notebooks/`: Directory containing Jupyter notebooks with exploratory analysis and time series modeling.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing helper Python scripts.
- `models/`: Directory containing saved models.
- `requirements.txt`: File with all project requirements.
- `README.md`: File containing project description.
- `LICENSE`: File containing project license.

## Instructions
1. Download the data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rossmann-store-sales/overview) and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks from the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data and perform time series modeling.
3. Customize the models according to your needs and optionally save them in the `models/` directory using the scripts from the `scripts/` directory.
